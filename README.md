# C/C++ ORM
---
Library structure:<br>
-> Database declaration<br>
-> Query builder<br>
-> (todo)Database drivers/dialects

### Use overview
---
Define the database structure with Table
Build the queries with select and etc
execute the queries
Every step is indepent and the objective is keep the driver in C and compativility with C

### Database declaration
---
Define the structure of the database form the poin of view of the program and stored in the metadata class.<br>
The definition is done with the class Table,Column and generator funtion table,column.

### Query builder
---
Using the schema delared in metadata or passed as parameters keep the necesary structures for generate the SQL. (the SQL is generated by the class Compiled)

### Dialects
---
Transform the Compiled class into string for every SQL engine

### Database drivers
---
The library suport multiple engines, for compatibility and easy develop (most of the engines are done in C)
i keep that part in C (a connection is not a class and not require OOP)
Engines suported: (in progres)
-> SQLite<br>
-> Postgresql<br>
The base of the engine part is the struct engine, with is a "interface to multiple methods" that should be declared in a engine

## todo list
---
Long list
Firstly reestructurate the namespace in expression/orm or core
Separate drivers for engine
